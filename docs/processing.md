# Media Processing

`ion-sfu` supports real-time processing on media streamed through the sfu using [`ion-avp`](https://github.com/pion/ion-avp).

For an example of recording a MediaStream to webm, checkout the [save-to-webm](https://github.com/pion/ion-avp/tree/master/examples/save-to-webm) example.
